1. Empty Rhetoric: Statements that appear meaningful or persuasive but lack substantive content or actionable insights.
2. Paltering: Statements that are technically true but intentionally omit key context or details, thereby misleading the audience.
3. Weasel Words: Language that appears informative but remains ambiguous, vague, or evasive, particularly qualifiers (“some,” “many,” “might,” “could”), passive constructions, and references to anonymous authorities (“it is thought,” “experts believe”).
4. Unverified Claim: Assertions confidently presented as true despite lacking sufficient evidence or verification. (e.g., stating unconfirmed product features)."""
